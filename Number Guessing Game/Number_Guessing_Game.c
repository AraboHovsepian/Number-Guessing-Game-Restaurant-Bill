/*
Show a menu consisting of three options. If option 1 is selected then the program
will prompt the user to enter a number and in case of win the program will let the user know
otherwise it will tell the user that the number was low or high and this will continue until the user wins.
q can cause the game to end and return to main. In case the user chooses the 2nd option, the user is going to be
prompted about the max allowable value and then the program will prevent any negative value insertation.
In case of option 3, the program will thank the user and print out the result for the game and number of guesses and quit
